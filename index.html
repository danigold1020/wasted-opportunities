                    For over a decade, UCLA and the UC Sustainable Practices Policy have been working to reach a goal of zero waste. However, despite their efforts, students are still struggling to access sustainable waste practices and tools. With the Wasted Opportunities survey study and website, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the community’s reasons for avoiding sustainable waste practices. Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. By surveying a variety of students, we hope to make a diverse map displaying people's perceptions, habits, and relationships to waste reduction, which will be shared with UCLA Sustainability’s Zero Waste Team to help explain the lack of compliance with UCLA’s waste reduction efforts and spark more interest in reducing waste.

            <h2>What is UCLA Zero Waste?</h2>
            <p>UCLA Sustainability has a wide variety of waste reduction goals that align with the University of California Sustainable Practices Policy. Since 2012, they have been aiming to reach a goal of zero waste, defined as a waste diversion rate of at least 95% by 2020. According to a 2020 UC Sustainability Annual Report, UCLA only reached about a 50% rate in 2020. UCLA has consistently fallen short of its zero waste targets, but there is a new target in place: 90% diversion from landfills, and 25% reduction of waste per capita from 2016 FY levels by 2025. Currently, UCLA recycles a wide variety of materials and is pursuing a number of waste reduction initiatives. The Zero Waste Program’s most recent initiative is Think outside the Landfill, which provides tips and resources on how to reduce and manage waste at home and on campus. </p>
