                    For over a decade, UCLA and the UC Sustainable Practices Policy have been working to reach a goal of zero waste. However, despite their efforts, students are still struggling to access sustainable waste practices and tools. With the Wasted Opportunities survey study and website, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the community’s reasons for avoiding sustainable waste practices. Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. By surveying a variety of students, we hope to make a diverse map displaying people's perceptions, habits, and relationships to waste reduction, which will be shared with UCLA Sustainability’s Zero Waste Team to help explain the lack of compliance with UCLA’s waste reduction efforts and spark more interest in reducing waste.
