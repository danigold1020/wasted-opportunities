> Wasted Opportunities is a mapplication (map application) project that displays UCLA students’ stories centered around waste management and reduction.

## :seedling:Objective
### What social problem is being addressed?
Since 2012, the University of California Sustainable Practices Policy has been aiming to reach a goal of zero waste, defined as a waste diversion rate of at least 95% by 2020. According to a 2020 UC Sustainability Annual Report, UCLA only reached about a 50% rate in 2020. With a new target in place: 90% diversion from landfills, and 25% reduction of waste per capita from 2016 FY levels by 2025, we wonder what UCLA is tangibly doing to make these goals a reality. Despite their efforts, community members are still struggling to access sustainable waste practices and tools. We hope to address this issue with our mapplication, Wasted Opportunities, and showcase student voices on waste reduction and management. Ultimately, we hope to assist UCLA Sustainability in understanding the community’s reasons for avoiding sustainable waste practices.

## :seedling:Who is being empowered?
Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins, as both groups will benefit from increased awareness about waste habits, reduction, and impact. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. Additionally, students living on and off-campus will be able to share their experiences, accounting for the varying habits and resources available for the two groups.

## :seedling:What technology was used?
In this project, we will be using software such as Leaflet and Papaparse to create our map and import in our survey data. Moreover, we will be utilizing multiple programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to create our mapplication.

### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Although we narrowed our scope to target only students, there are still a wide variety of experiences and backgrounds within this community in regard to waste management and information. Thus, beginning with a smaller sample, the stories we receive may not represent every single perspective. Some technical problems that could occur are issues with mostly blank survey responses. Since a majority of our questions are not required, this could lead to incomplete profiles.

### Long-term Impact
We hope that this project will bring awareness to UCLA’s zero waste goals. Our map filled with waste ‘profiles’ of the community will provide anecdotes and insight as to why UCLA is missing its zero waste target. By surveying a variety of student community members, we hope to make a diverse map displaying people's perceptions, habits, and relationships to waste reduction, which could help explain the lack of compliance with UCLA’s waste reduction efforts and spark more interest in reducing waste. The mapplication could be distributed to UCLA’s Environmental Student Network and the sustainability team of the housing association, where it could be shared along with current waste reduction infographics on the hill. We can also provide our mapplication to UCLA Sustainability’s Zero Waste team so that they are better informed about student waste habits.
