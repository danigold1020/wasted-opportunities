            <h2 id="subheading">what is wasted opportunities?</h2>
            <p><i>Wasted Opportunities</i> is a mapplication (map application) project that displays UCLA students’ stories centered around waste management and reduction. Through these stories, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the community’s waste management habits and reasons for avoiding sustainable waste practices. </p>
            <p>It was created and by <b>Penelope (Lillan) Lamb</b> and <b>Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen</b> for AAS191A in Spring 2022.</p>
                
            <h2 id="subheading">background</h2>
            <p>Since 2012, the University of California Sustainable Practices Policy has been aiming to reach a goal of zero waste, defined as a waste diversion rate of at least 95% by 2020. According to a 2020 UC Sustainability Annual Report, UCLA only reached about a 50% rate in 2020. UCLA has consistently fallen short of its zero waste targets, with more than 1 million pounds of waste being produced on campus each year. With a new target in place: 90% diversion from landfills, and 25% reduction of waste per capita from 2016 FY levels by 2025, we wonder what UCLA is tangibly doing to make these goals a reality. Despite their efforts, community members are still struggling to access sustainable waste practices and tools.</p>
                
            <h2 id="subheading">who is being empowered?</h2>
            <p>Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins, as both groups will benefit from increased awareness about waste habits, reduction, and impact. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. Additionally, students living on and off-campus will be able to share their experiences, accounting for the varying habits and resources available for the two groups.</p>
                
            <h2 id="subheading">what technology is being used?</h2>
            <p>In this project, we use software such as Leaflet and Papaparse to create our map and import in the survey data. Additionally, we utlize multiple programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to create  and maintain this mapplication.</p>
                
            <h2 id="subheading">limitations</h2>
            <p>Even though we do our best to consider design and data justice as we build this mapplication and continue to improve on it, there are technical and ethical problems that could occur in the development and further use of this tool. Although we narrowed our scope to target only students, there are still a wide variety of experiences and backgrounds within this community in regard to waste management and information. Thus, beginning with a smaller sample, the stories we receive may not represent every single perspective out there. Some technical problems that could occur are issues with mostly blank survey responses. Since a majority of our questions are not required, this could lead to some incomplete profiles.</p>
                
            <h2 id="subheading">how can you use this project in the future?</h2>
            <p>UCLA students and future community members can use this mapplication to gain a deeper understanding of the different perspectives surrounding waste management on campus. As more students add their stories, hopefully future students will be able to use this as a tool to gauge how the student body is feeling towards UCLA's goals. It can also be a place to see that they are not alone in their feelings towards the current program. UCLA Sustainability and other campus environmental organizations can utilize our project to gather data on public perception and potentially try out some of the suggested solutions from the responses. By returning to the website to click and read through student stories, as well as adding their own, student community members and UCLA admin can better understand where students are coming from and enact change.</p>
